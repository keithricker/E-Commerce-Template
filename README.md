### Widgets Unlimited: A Mock E-Commerce Site Built with React
#### Note: App was created in 2021 (with only a few of the images updated), so enjoy this "React time machine" (including the class based components).
#### This is the Express Server Root Directory. React Project is in the /client directory.

#### Folder Structure:  
- **server.js:** Where the server-side code resides
- **SSR.js** (server-side rendering): This script is called on post-build, and pre-renders the html.
- **/client:** Directory where the React Application resides. Created using create-react-app (project follows that basic structure).
