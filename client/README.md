### Widgets Unlimited: A Mock E-Commerce Site Built with React 

#### Note: App was created in 2021 and has some outdated packages (which will soon be updated), so this is only recommended for demo purposes and/or code evaluation. 

#### Running start script from the root directory ( ../ one level up) will serve a pre-compiled (server-side rendered) version of this app on port 3001. To run the React app in development mode (with local development server), do 'npm run development' from the root directory. Run 'npm build' from this directory if you want development changes to reflect on the node server.

#### This is the React Project Directory. Node/Express Server is (../) one level up.

#### To highlight the customizable nature of the store, a few basic configuration changes have been made to transform the site in to a Dairy Supplier
